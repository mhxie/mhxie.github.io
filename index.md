Hello! I am an Infrastructure Engineer at Anyscale, where I focus on building reliable and performant data plane supporting [Ray](https://www.ray.io/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from UC Santa Cruz (2025, expected), co-advised by Prof. [Heiner Litz](https://people.ucsc.edu/~hlitz/) and Prof. [Chen Qian](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~qian/) (supported by [CRSS](https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/index.html)/NSF). My doctoral research centered on **Distributed Storage Systems**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Quality of Service**. Post my graduation, I maintain a strong research interest in distributed **LLM memory**.

Previously, I received my B.E. in Computer Science (with honors) from Sichuan University in 2018, and was selected as a Computer Science Star.
